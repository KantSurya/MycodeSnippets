Dynamic Programming

01. ncr-> Compute ncr recursively
02. 2D array prefix sum -> given a 2d array, find the sum of sub matrix in O(1) complexity
03. Cutting a Rod -> Given a rod of length n inches and an array of prices that contains prices of all pieces of size smaller
                     than n. Determine the maximum value obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces
